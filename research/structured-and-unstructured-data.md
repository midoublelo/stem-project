# Structured and Unstructured Data
-----
Structured Data is comprised of clearly defined data types with patterns that make them easily searchable while unstructured data is comprised of data that is usually not as easily searchable, including formats like audio, video, and social media posts.

## Structured Data
Structured Data usually resides in relational databases where fields store data like phone numbers or postcodes. They may even contain text strings like names which make it easier to search. The format is very searchable through the use of both queries and algorithms using types of data and field names, such as alphabetical or numeric, currency, or date.

### Examples
- Dates
- Phone Numbers
- Addresses
### Pros & Cons
| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| Easily used by machine learning algorithms | Limited usage |
| Easily used by business users | Limited storage options |
|  Accessible by more tools |
### Tools
- SQLite
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

## Unstructured Data
Unstructured Data is essentially everything that does not fall under Structured Data. It may be textual or non-textual, and human- or machine-generated. Because of this, it is inherently harder to search in nature.
### Examples
#### Human-Generated
- Text Files
- Email
- Social Media

#### Machine-Generated
- Satellite Imagery
- Digital Surveillance
- Scientific Data
### Pros & Cons
| Pros | Cons |
| ----- | ----- |
| Native format | Requires expertise |
| Fast accumulation rates | Specialized tools |
|  Data lake storage |
### Tools
- MongoDB
- Hadoop
- Azure

## Definitions
-----
Data lake: A centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. It can store data in its native format and process any variety of it, ignoring size limits.
