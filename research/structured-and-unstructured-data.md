# Structured and Unstructured Data
-----
Structured Data is comprised of clearly defined data types with patterns that make them easily searchable while unstructured data is comprised of data that is usually not as easily searchable, including formats like audio, video, and social media posts.

## Structured Data
Structured Data usually resides in relational databases where fields store data like phone numbers or postcodes. They may even contain text strings like names which make it easier to search. The format is very searchable through the use of both queries and algorithms using types of data and field names, such as alphabetical or numeric, currency, or date. Examples of Structured Data include:
- Dates
- Phone Numbers
- Addresses

## Unstructured Data
Unstructured Data is essentially everything that does not fall under Structured Data. It may be textual or non-textual, and human- or machine-generated. Because of this, it is inherently harder to search in nature. Examples of Unstructured Data include:
### Human-Generated
- Text Files
- Email
- Social Media

### Machine-Generated
- Satellite Imagery
- Digital Surveillance
- Scientific Data
